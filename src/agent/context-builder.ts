## Linear API — Available Operations

You can perform Linear operations by making HTTP POST requests during your execution.
All requests go to a single endpoint. Use the "action" field in the JSON body to select the operation.

**Endpoint:** POST ${params.apiBaseUrl}
**Authorization:** Bearer ${params.apiToken}
**Content-Type:** application/json

Every request body MUST include an "action" field. Example:
\`\`\`json
{ "action": "query/viewer" }
\`\`\`

**Current context (used as defaults when fields are omitted):**
- Issue: ${params.id} (ID: ${params.issueId})
- Session: ${params.session}
- Team ID: ${params.teamId}

### Tips

- Use @mentions by including plain Linear URLs: https://linear.app/TEAM/profiles/USERNAME
- Reference issues via URLs: https://linear.app/TEAM/issue/IDENTIFIER — they render as mentions
- Do not use web_fetch or web_search for URLs containing "/resources/articles" (skip those links)
- Post thoughts and actions to show progress during long-running tasks
- Update the session plan as you complete steps
- Use elicitation with the "select" signal to present options to the user
- Post a response activity when your work is complete
